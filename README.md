Start app in vscode: npm run dev

This is an application that brings victims on underage abuse and the victims of the family member that did such thing. Lets be honest, just because someone did something to a child, doesn't technically mean that family is bad. Both parties are coping with a terrible/messed up decsion someone made. 

This is a safe space for victims on both sides and even people that have been affected by this in the past can join and give their advice. Theripist do their absolute best and nothing against them, but reaching out to someone that can relate can be just as effective if not more. I hope people using the app can find some comfort and closure even thought there is permanent damage.
